# Redefining Cancer Treatment
In the past several years, researchers have been trying new ways to treat cancer with precision medicine and genetic testing customized to the specific patient. However, analyzing genetic information is a very time-consuming task. A cancer tumor can have thousands of different mutations, and the clinical pathologist must manually review every single genetic mutation by reading long pages of clinical literature.
Therefore, this project's goal is to predict cancerous genes, each with one of its possible variations, into a few mutation classes based on clinical text.
